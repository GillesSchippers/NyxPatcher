```

### Command-line Options

| Option | Description |

Check for updates with default settings:
```

Force refresh and automatically download all updates:
```
python -m nyxpatcher --force --download-all
```

Perform a dry run to see what would be updated:
```
python -m nyxpatcher --dry-run
```

Use a custom configuration file:

```

## Supported Mod Platforms

### Modrinth

[Modrinth](https://modrinth.com/) is an open-source mod platform for Minecraft with a focus on providing a clean, modern interface and a fair revenue sharing model for creators. NyxPatcher uses Modrinth's API to search for and download mod updates.

Key benefits of Modrinth:
- No API key required
- Fast and reliable API
- Usually provides direct download links
- Support for modern mod versions

### CurseForge

[CurseForge](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft) is the largest and most established mod repository for Minecraft, hosting thousands of mods, resource packs, and other content. To use CurseForge with NyxPatcher, you'll need a CurseForge API key, which can be obtained from [https://console.curseforge.com/](https://console.curseforge.com/).

Key benefits of CurseForge:
- Largest collection of mods available
- Long history with extensive mod version archives
- Support for older Minecraft versions
- Detailed mod metadata

## How It Works

1. The tool scans your mod directories and extracts metadata from each mod
2. It checks mod repositories for newer versions compatible with your Minecraft version
3. A summary of available updates is displayed
4. In interactive mode, you can select which mods to update
5. Selected mod updates are downloaded to your configured download directory
6. When auto-install is enabled (via `--auto-install` or `"auto_install": true` in config):
   - The old mod file is backed up to the configured `backup_directory`
   - The newly downloaded mod is copied into the same mod directory as the old version
   - The old mod file is removed, leaving only the updated version in place
7. A detailed report is generated showing all mod statuses
